Matlab codes to generate the results presented in the paper. 

The codes used for the results reported in the manuscript are included as Supplementary Material. The codes are written in Matlab and require the Neural Network Toolbox. The codes are:

DataGen.m. A code to generate database (inputs and targets) using circles. The volume fraction of interface cell and its adjacent cells is found as input data and the target is the curvature of interface cell which is constant for a circle. The saved .mat file contains  an input matrix with nine columns and a target matrix with one column. More data could be generated by changing the radius of the circle or the grid spacing. The distribution of circle sizes is generated using a piecewise linear function which is slightly different than the one used in the final version of the paper.

ML-Train.m. A code to solve an input-output problem with the Neural Network tool box in MATLAB. One may also do the same thing using GUI by typing ``nftool'' in the command window. The code assumes that two variables are defined: input - input data and output - output  data.

VOF-ML.m. A very simple Navier-Stokes solver for a drop in a rectangular box, using a conservative form of the equations.  A 3-order explicit projection method and centered in space discretizations are used. The density is advected by a front tracking scheme and surface tension and variable viscosity is included. The VOF volume fraction is found directly from the front and the surface tension is found by machine learning
 
NNCircle2.m. The neural network simulation function generated by ML-Train.m and called by VOF-ML.m. Generated by Neural Network Toolbox function genFunction, 13-May-2018
